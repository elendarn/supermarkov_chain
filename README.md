## Introduction

This repository contains the code and data for my project on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations applied to analyze the behavior of different customer types and their impact on traffic and congestion levels in supermarkets. The project aims to provide insights into the dynamics of customer behavior and its implications for supermarket operations.

## Project Description

The project leverages MCMC simulations, a powerful computational technique, to model and analyze customer behavior patterns within the context of the DOODL Supermarket dataset. By understanding how different customer types behave, we can gain valuable insights into traffic flow, congestion levels, and optimize various supermarket operations.

The main objectives of this project are as follows:

1. **Data Exploration**: Perform a comprehensive exploration of the DOODL Supermarket dataset to gain an understanding of its structure, variables, and potential relationships.

2. **Customer Segmentation**: Utilize advanced machine learning techniques to segment customers into distinct types based on their behavior, such as shopping preferences, timing, and movement patterns within the supermarket.

3. **Markov Chain Modeling**: Develop Markov chain models to capture the probabilistic transitions between different supermarket areas and customer states. This enables us to simulate customer movements and evaluate the impact on traffic and congestion levels.

4. **MCMC Simulations**: Employ MCMC simulations to estimate the posterior distributions of model parameters, enabling us to analyze the uncertainty associated with the customer behavior models and their impact on supermarket traffic.

5. **Traffic Analysis**: Investigate the effects of different customer types on supermarket traffic and congestion levels, including peak hours, bottlenecks, and hotspots. This analysis provides actionable insights for supermarket managers to optimize layouts, staffing, and operational strategies.

# supermarkov_chain
Code and data for my project on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations applied to analyze the behavior of different customer types and their impact on traffic and congestion levels in supermarkets. The project aims to provide insights into the dynamics of customer behavior and its implications for supermarket operations.
